## Dotfiles Installation

Dotfiles is a generic term for configuration files that represent a wide
variety for applications. The name derives from that fact that these files
begin their names with a dot. *By default*, dotfiles are hidden in file and
directory listings. Search GitHub for the string `dotfiles` to see how your
fellow developers use their dotfiles.

Move the dotfiles directory to your home directory

```bash
$ mv dotfiles ~
```

Move  the gitconfig file to your home directory 

```bash
$ mv gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```

## Test Data

Within this repo, is a directory `test-data` containing test data. This is
available to help you learn Git's commands.
